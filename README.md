## My process

### Built with

- BEM HTML5 markup with Emmet
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Sortable.js](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable)

### What I learned

- I learned more DOM Manipulation methods in Javascript and used the classList API
- I combined data attributes and SCSS mixins to chaneg the colors by theme chosen by the user
- I used the Scrollable.js library for the drag and drop effect of every list item
- I learned how to build this project using Parcel
- I further practiced the fluid leyout for the responsive design of this project

### Continued development 

- The drag and drop functionality of this app could be improved by making it less sensitive when user would click the radio 
- I want to master the usage of data attributes and find out more about the things I could use it with
- I want to further my understanding of SCSS mixins and functions
- I want to be able to use more libraries for my future projects jsut like the implementation of the Scrollable.js in this one because it is really helpful and convenient
